1. Method 1 give a better result. Because Method 2 the result relies on some other factors. We can quickly get the final result(4.1img_average.png) with 300 pictures captured from the video(traffic.mp4). As to the method 2, even the procedure with 30 pictures would take a relative long time to get the result(4.2img_kmeans30.png). When it comes to 300 pictures, the processing will occupy a lot of CPU resources and what¡¯s worse compared with method 1, the result(4.2img_kmeans300.png) is not so ideal.
2. Use 3 matrixes to store the values of each pixel¡¯s BRG. and then the cv2.kmeans() function will help us to calculate and pick up the value we want. additionally, we combine B, R, G value for each pixel and create a new matrix to store 480 * 640 pixels¡¯ information. Finally, we require cv2.imwrite() function to transform the matrix to the real image. More details are give in the Q4.2Backgroud.py.
