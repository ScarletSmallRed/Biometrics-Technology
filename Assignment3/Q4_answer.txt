1.The first 50 singular values are munch larger than the values behind 50.Also, the singular value s become smaller as the number grows larger. So, we can come to a assumption that when the number is smaller the more important the singular value is.

2.When printing the compressed images, I notice that when the K is small, for example, from 20 to 80, the differences between images are obvious. However, when K is bigger than 150, the differences are very small. This notice comfirms the assumption in the first quertion.
