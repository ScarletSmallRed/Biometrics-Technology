# Assignment 3: Detect Face

In this task, you will learn face detection with OpenCV. OpenCV provide a Haar-cascade Classifier for face detection, which is a good start for you to explore face recognition. A function is defined in partII.py for you to run face detection on an image. Read the code and understand it. Use the function to explore the capability Haar-cascade face detector.

Q5. Illumination can affect the performance of a face detector. Apply the face detectionfunction on test1.png, test2.png and test3.png compare the results.

Q6. What other factors do you think can affect the performance of the face detector?

Q7. Try to verify your ideas Q6 by using your own images.
